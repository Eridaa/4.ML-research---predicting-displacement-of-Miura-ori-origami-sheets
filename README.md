INTRODUCTION
 
Mechanical metamaterials are artificial structures with mechanical properties defined by their structure and material,  rather than their composition. They exhibit properties not found in natural materials, such as a negative Poissonâ€™s ratio.

Origami Metamaterials combine the japanese art of paper folding to create metamaterials that have properties derived from both the properties of the sheet material and geometric arrangement of the folding. The physical properties of origami metamaterials, in particular the Miura-Ori fold, have been recently researched. These metamaterials can be used for a variety of applications in the realm of product design including soft robotics, aerospace, civil engineering structures, and safety equipment.

Origami has been employed in the creation of deployable metamaterials that fold and unfold along the crease lines. The desired deployability and collapsibility of these metamaterials are often controlled through a tunable stiffness parameter. The stiffness, k  of a body is a measure of the resistance offered by an elastic body to deformation and for origami metamaterials, it is determined by the displacement and degree of freedom of its vertices, and applied load.

In this project we will try to predict the displacement of Miura-Ori based origami metamaterials.
